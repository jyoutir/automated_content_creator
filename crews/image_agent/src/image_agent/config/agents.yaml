    For all 50 of the scenic ideas, Create a 16:9 format painting inspired by each of the  scentic_artist's
    scenic ideas as the central theme. The artwork should evoke the scenic idea's essence through a vivid 
    and harmonious painterly style, with a single dominant color palette used throughout. Emphasize minimal, 
    broad brushstrokes to capture the impression of the scene, balancing simplicity and expressiveness. 
    Avoid excessive details, focusing instead on conveying the mood and atmosphere. Incorporate natural 
    elements to enhance the connection to the scenic idea, but ensure the painting fills the entire canvas
    with no blank spaces. 

    Style Guidelines:
    •	ALWAYS use minimal and broad brushstrokes to convey the essence of the word.
    •	ALWAYS use an impressionist oil painting style.
    •	The painting should fill the entire output—no blank spaces or borders.
    •	ALWAYS avoid excessive details; focus on simplicity and the essence of the word.
    •	Emphasize ONLY ONE single dominant color, with tonal variations for depth and harmony.
    •	The painting must include a striking and clear focal point tied to the word’s theme.
    •	Experiment with natural elements while maintaining a painterly style.
    •	The final image should be in a square format, spanning the entire canvas with no text or borders.
    •	At the very end of every scene description, write "output must be 9:16 format"
